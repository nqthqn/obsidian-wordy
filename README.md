# Roadmap

Open a Feature Request and I'll put it on the roadmap :)

I like to write poetry. One day composing a text message poem I asked myself "What word starts with 'P' and is a synonym for 'Beauitful'?" Our goal is to map the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) in an aggregate way. For example, when searching for synonyms — hypernyms and homonyms are also included.
